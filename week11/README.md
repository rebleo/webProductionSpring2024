#### Final Project
Your Final Must be a contemporary responsive web site. It can **not** be a portfolio site. I am not setting a page # requirement, but will be looking for evidence that you put effort into making the most technically + aesthetically sophisticated project you can.

If programming seems daunting - your JS can be minimal, but in this case perhaps you will want to become an expert with CSS animations or the like? I will also accept web-based code projects using p5.js as it has [great](https://p5js.org/) resources outside the [classroom](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) no really [truly amazing resources with coorperate backing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBFcNPa36m8) - but individual sketches must be linked from a home index page.

* Original Content - no memes!
This should be a portfolio piece you can refer to after you graduate to showcase both your design + technical abilities (image-making is also a skill).
  * Wireframe and site map
  * HTML structure with CSS styling
  * CSS - use of classes and IDs, as well as pseudo classes
  * CSS Positioning and Layout (responsive, flex or grid)
  * JavaScript Interactivity
  * Thoughtful + Appealing Design
  * Posted to Your FM Server

#### Time-Frame + Deliverables
* ASYNCH BEFORE MAY 1
  * an email to me with your concept for your final, wireframes, site map and design strategy. And any questions you have. You **must** get the okay from me before you begin to build your site (i will answer these in the order i get them - better get on it now so you have more time to build). and remember I check my nyu address more often than my hunter. 
* Week 12 - Tuesday May 7th
  *  **User Testing** 
  * Attendance is mandatory. If you do not come to user testing you will lose 10% of your grade for the final project. 
  * Due in class
    * Wireframes, sitemap and design strategy
    * a working prototype of your website and questions for your classmates about it's tech or design
* Tuesday May 14
  * Final projects due in class. Again, you must attend and give feedback to your classmates.
