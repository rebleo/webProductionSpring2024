### ðŸ’¾   Pair programming presentation net.art project
##### In class presentations are due Tuesday March 26
With a partner, choose 1 artwork from either the [Rhizome's net.art Anthology](https://anthology.rhizome.org/) or [Chronus Art Center's WE-LINK 4 online exhibitions](http://we-link.chronusartcenter.org/) to present to the class in a 5  minute presentation. 
* You MUST create your [slide deck](https://www.google.com/search?q=slide+deck&oq=slide+deck&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l9.3609j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) using HTML, CSS + host on your class site. Each slide should be a relative link to another html page or a more sophisticated system if you choose. Use an external styling sheet to keep the styling of your presentation uniform. 
* Your slide deck website must include:
  * A clear wireframe and plan for execution
  * it's own directory + file path linked from your class site home page
  * Multiple HTML pages controlled by 1 external styling sheet
  * Flex and Grid Display on some portion of the pages
  * Some navigation with links to relative file path to go to the next "slide"
  * at least one [media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries)
  * at least one instance of CSS [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors) + one [id](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors)
  * pictures and an "images" or "assets" directory to hold your media. A "pages" or "slides" directory to hold your pages.
* Post a link to your net.art Presentation Web Site (Slide Deck) 
* Remember this is a presentation to the class. We should hear from both people in the partnership on both the response to the artwork as well as the code itself. And if you want to somehow make yr presention interactive // inspired by the work you reserached - that's even better!

##### In class tonite
In the next ten or so minutes, discuss with your partner which artwork / artist you plan to work on and once you've agreed post a link to the work by your names [here](https://github.com/rebleo/webProductionSpring2024/wiki/Week-07). **You can not do an artwork that has been posted by another pair!!** 

By the end of class you should have a web page prototype that houses your concept, inspiration, wire frames and plan of execution. 

##### For Sunday Night
You should meet with your partner at least twice in this process. Before Sunday night at 6pm please add a screenshot of your virtual or pic of your irl meeting next to your names on the wiki
